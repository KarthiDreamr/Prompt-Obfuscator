- Accent color: Muted blue (#668BA4) to complement the primary color and provide visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern and readable user interface.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent functions like copy and character addition.
- A clean, user-friendly layout with a focus on readability and ease of use.
- Subtle animations, such as a fade-in effect when the text is processed or a scale animation for buttons.
